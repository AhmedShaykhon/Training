## 1- What ’re the methods that you used ?
> There are many important methods used and the target of these methods is to focus on string, date and time manipulation background, For instance, character frequency checking, change number of characters in the string, swap a part of two strings, add some characters in the string, display date such as year, month, days and also time and counter of seconds, display a day date, add or subtract a number of seconds compared with the current time, convert the format of the data to another format, check the current milliseconds current week, check conditional state with string, and finally calculate the area of a trapezoid.

## 2- Explain each method ..
> ### I will mention the objective of the tasks which solved in the Task three notebook by showing every following point for every function mentioned.

> 1. This function showing how to numbering the string and write it with the number in the dictionary.
> 2. This function checks the repeated character and replaces it with $ character.
> 3. This function target is to swap the first two characters in the two strings with each other.
> 4. This function is to add 'ing' at the end of a given string (length should be at least 3). If the given string already ends with 'ing' then add 'ly' instead. If the string length of the given string is less than 3, leave it unchanged.
> 5. This function displays the various date time formats suchas current date and time, current year, the month of yeat, week number of the year, day of the month, and finally the current day of the current week.
> 6. This function is to get the Date of the next and previous day.
> 7. This function is to add a number of seconds to the current time and display it.
> 8. This function to change the format of date using DateTime.datetime.now().
> 9. This function to count and display the current time in millisecond.
> 10. This function to get the week count and this function have to take the current date as an input parameter.
> 11. This function checking the string starts with 'a' and ends with 'b' or not.
> 12. This function is to calculate the area of a trapezoid.

## 3- What’s new for you?
> These methods help me to be familiar with the string functions. Besides, how to deal with many formats of the date and time.
