## 1- What ’re the methods that you used ?
> There are many important methods used. For instance, creating a method for filling and printing a variable with dictionary type, the functions of the dictionary library,
    checking the variable either empty or not,  using a variable with a tuple, set and frozenset data type and manipulate for the set functions, using the maximum and minimum
    function, sorting elements depends on the priority of the sorted element, creating several elements with an input range, checking the time execution of any function and
    finally, the shuffle function.

## 2- Explain each method ..
> ### The Following fifteen note for the fifteen tasks which mentioned in our second task.
> 1. Dictionary input parameter type Function: This Function objective is how to deal with the dictionary data type and how you fill it with the keys and values and display it.
> 2. The same previous target with a limited range of elements using range function, display the values of the dictionary variable only and using functions of the dictionary such as dic.values() and dic.items().
> 3. The same previous target but in this function we need to display just the keys of the dictionary using dic.keys() function. Besides display the dictionary items using dic.items() function.
> 4. checking the variable status either empty or not.
> 5. using set functions suchas first_variable.issubset(second_variable) for checking the first variable is a subset of the second variable or not and this function return true or false.
> 6. using set functions suchas first_variable.difference(second_variable) for getting the member of the first variable which not included in the second variable. Besides, the asymmetric difference function which detects the whole elements in the first variable set and second variable set except intersection elements between the first variable set and second variable set. Moreover using a union function of sets that detect the whole elements which exist in the two sets.
> 7. using frozenset object which is immutable and used with many functions suchas intersection, difference, union, is disjoint, issubset, copy, issuperset and symmetric_difference. Besides, I used function isdisjoint() which Return True if the set has no elements in common with other or return the element which not common.
> 8. using the maximum or minimum function.
> 9. tuple splitting and display every part in different lines.
> 10. inserting a tuple variable and display it depending on the priority of the elements.
> 11. creating a random number of elements depending on the random function.
> 12. creating a random even number of elements depending on the random function.
> 13. creating a random number of elements and the range is between two numbers depending on the random function.
> 14. detecting the time of function execution.
> 15. shuffle function which swaps the members of the set variable and displays it.


## 3- What’s new for you ?

> #### Revising the functions of the set variable. Besides, I found a new knowledge about frozenset datatype and asymmetric difference.
