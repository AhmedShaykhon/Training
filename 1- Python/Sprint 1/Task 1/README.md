## 1- What ’re the methods that you used?
> There are many important methods used. For instance, casting methods (integer to string or vice versa), concatenate two strings, check the length of the string, checking the number if it is even or odd, applying the functions of string and list data type, using a recursive function in task 10 was outstanding chance to check the programming background.

## 2- Explain each method...
> ### the methods used in concentrating on the string manipulating. Besides, how to build your function and use it in the code or how to import function ready to use from the library. Moreover, I will mention the functions used in task 1.
> 1. Summation function: this function takes two-parameter and adds each other than return the result.
> 2. Square method: this function takes one parameter and returns the square value of this number.
> 3. Integer to String Convert Function: this function takes one parameter which is Integer and returns string parameter.
> 4. String to Integer Convert Function: this function takes one parameter which is a string and returns the Integer parameter.
> 5. Convert and Concatenate two Integers function: this function takes two parameters which are an integer type and retune string.
> 6. String Comparing function: This function takes two string, checking the length of the two strings then depending on the length of the two string. and the code decides which one will be the return of the function: on the other hand, if the two strings have the equality length of the string, the code should return the two strings.
> 7. Parity check Function: This function takes one parameter and checks this parameter whether even number or odd and display it
> 8. Yes, word Check function: This function just checks whether the probability of writing "yes" word is existing. So, the function with return Yes. and if is not existing so the function with return the word which written.
> 9. Conditional Function with a range of numbers: The function which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200, and the return value is a string in one line.
> 10. Factorial function: I used a recursive function because the size of the code will be less than the iterative function.
> 11. Summation and multiplication combination function: This function takes one parameter and it multiplies this number with itself with the times which equal the iterative loop and at the end of every loop. the result will be added to the last result of the previous iterative loop. and at the end of the iterative loop will return the result at the end of the function

## 3- What’s new for you?
> #### Firstly, I found that practice every time improves your capability of solving the code, will improve your confidence in your code, will decrease the syntax error mistakes. Secondly, it improves also the way of writing concise documentation for every task. In conclusion, I think all these factors are effective ways to improve my skills in coding.
