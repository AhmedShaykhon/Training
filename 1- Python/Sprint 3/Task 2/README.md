|                Counter()              | A Counter is a dict subclass for counting hashable objects.                             |
|                                       | It is an unordered collection where elements are stored as dictionary keys              |
|                                       | and their counts are stored as dictionary values.                                       |

|            OrderedDict()              | OrderedDict is a dict subclass that maintains the items insertion order.                |
|                                       | When we iterate over an OrderedDict, items are returned in the order they were inserted.|                                               |                                       |                                                                                         |
|              deque()                  | Returns a new deque object initialized left-to-right (using append()) with data from    |
|                                       | iterable. If iterable is not specified, the new deque is empty.                         |
