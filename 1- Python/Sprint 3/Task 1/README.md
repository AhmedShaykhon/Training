## 1- What ’re the methods that you used ?

>  The functions which used in this task, itertools.product(), itertools.permutations(), itertools.combinations(), itertools.combinations_with_replacement(), Compress the String by using groupby function.


## 2- Explain each method ..

> 1. itertools.product(): This function is used to find the cartesian product from the given iterator, the output is lexicographic order.
> 2. itertools.permutations(): to get all possible full length permutations are generated. Permutations are printed in lexicographically sorted order. So, if the input iterable is sorted, the permutation tuples will be produced in sorted order.
> 3. itertools.combinations(): Return the length subsequences of elements from the list. Combinations are emitted in lexicographic sort order. So, if the input iterable is sorted, the combination tuples will be produced in sorted order.
> 4. itertools.combinations_with_replacement(): Return the length subsequences of elements from the list allowing individual elements to be repeated more than once. Combinations are emitted in lexicographic sort order.
> 5. Compress the String by using groupby function: To get the probability of letter an in the group of lists.

## 3- What’s new for you?

> All of these functions are new for me and I checked the parameters of these functions and how to use it in my code.
