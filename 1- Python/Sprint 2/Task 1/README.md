## 1- What ’re the methods that you used ?

> There are many important methods used. For instance, Creating nested if for the function to filter a number of required cases, Creating target-dependent methods by executing and calling it, trained on many operators to revise, using .format() function in many scopes, checking function for the input year either Leap or not, creating a function for giving sequence up to the value of the input element.



## 2- Explain each method ..

> ### The Following seven-note for the seven tasks which mentioned in our second task.
> 1. Hello, World! function: This Function objective is to print the text of hello, world.
> 2. Even and Odd Function: Creating nested if for the function to filter the number of required cases. Moreover depending on the function. the cases with print weird or not weird.
> 3. Calculator Function: This function used to take two parameters and manipulate them depends on the required operation, I used .format() function to apply every operation in one line.
> 4. Carry Function: This function checked if the result of the division is float or integer and how I ignore the float.
> 5. power Function: This Function used to get the power square of many elements is a loop.
> 6. Leap Year Function: This Function used to check the input year to the code is leap or not. and the benefit of this function is how to use nested if and return more than one case.
> 7. Consecutive Values Function: This function take one parameter which is an integer and it's getting the whole numbers from one up to this value, the benefit of this function is how you use print more than once and print the whole numbers in the same line.


## 3- What’s new for you ?

> #### How you use print more than once and print the whole numbers in the same line.
