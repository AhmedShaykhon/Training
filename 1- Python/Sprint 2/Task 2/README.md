## 1- What ’re the methods that you used ?

> There are many important methods used. For instance, List Comprehensions, Find the Runner-Up Score! , Nested Lists, Finding the percentage, Lists methods such as insert, print, remove, append, sort, pop, and reverse, Tuples data type passes to the hash function.

## 2- Explain each method ..
> ### The Following seven-note for the seven tasks mentioned in our second task.
> 1. List Comprehensions: This function used nested for ignoring display the lists which have the same number of the element summation. 
> 2. Find the Runner-Up Score! : This function is sorting the input number of elements and return the second smallest element in the list.
> 3. Nested Lists: This function is taking a list of students with their grades and return either the second smallest record or second smallest records if we have more than the same one.
> 4. Finding the percentage: This function takes a list of students with their grades and returns the average of the selected students.
> 5. Lists methods: This function collects the methods of the list such as insert, print, remove, append, sort, pop, and reverse and call these methods through the command line.
> 6. Tuple to hash: this function Tuple used to take the string and split it and cast it to an integer to send it to the hash function.

## 3- What’s new for you ?

> #### checking the second smallest score in the function 3. provide me time for practice. Besides, using map function is very interesting to mention. Finally, using the list functions in the command line is outstanding manipulation with the features of the python language.
