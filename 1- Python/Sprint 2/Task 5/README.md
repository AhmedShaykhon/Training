## 1- What’re the methods that you used?

>There are many important methods used. For instance, Polar Coordinates function, Find Angle MBC, a palindromic triangle of size N, Mod Divmod, Power - Mod Power,  add with the power of two numbers, display Triangle consists of repeated numbers of ever row.


## 2- Explain each method ..

> ### The Following seven notes for the seven tasks mentioned in our second task.

> Polar Coordinates function: This function converts from complex to polar form.

> Find Angle MBC: This function finds the angle by calculating the atan() from the length of side AB and length of side BC.

> A palindromic triangle of size N: dawing a pattern of the triangle, N is the number of rows.

> Mod Divmod: the result of the modulus operator: a % b and div operator a//b.

> Power - Mod Power: To take 3 inputs a,b, and c the get a ^ b and get the models of them by m.

> Add with the power of two numbers: to get the power of every number and add the results.

> display Triangle consists of repeated numbers of ever row.

## 3- What’s new for you?

> #### First of all, I observed the variety of tasks which is useful for Building patterns and dealing with operators and polar function.
