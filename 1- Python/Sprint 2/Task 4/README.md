## 1- What ’re the methods that you used ?

> There are many important methods used suchas Get Average and set functions. For instance, No Idea function if the selected element is an element of selected set or not, Symmetric Difference, Set.add(), Set .discard(), Set.remove(), Set .union(), Set .intersection() which is one of set functions, Set .difference(), Set .symmetric_difference(), Set Mutations (Set.update(), Set.intersection_update(), Set.difference_update(), Set.symmetric_difference_update(), Set.issuperset(), Set.issubset()

## 2- Explain each method.

> ### The Following thirteen note for the thirteen tasks which mentioned in our Fourth task.

> 1. Average Function created and used to get the average of all the plants with distinct heights in her greenhouse.

> 2. Check the input elements in which set is found and add or subtract one from indicated variable

> 3. Using Symmetric Difference set function to display The set the elements which exist in m_list a not exist in n_list

> 4. Using  .add() function to add new element to my list.

> 5. Uing Set .discard(), .remove() & .pop() in the list and highlight the difference between these instructions. 
> <ul>
> <li>Set.discard(): if you use this function to remove an element from your list and your list is already empty, it will not return false.</li>
> <li>Set.remove(): it will remove the selected element and it will return an error if the set is empty.</li>
> <li>Set.pop(): it will return the latest element is pushed on the list.</li>
> </ul>

> 6. Set.union(): to collect all elements in two sets in one set except the duplicated elements

> 7. Set.intersection(): To find the common elements in the two sets and return these elements.

> 8. A.difference(B): the elements which inside A and not inside B

> 9. set1.symmetric_difference(set2): The all unduplicated elements.

> 10. Set Mutations: use set functions to check and 4 set functions but with update the new set in A. 

> <ul>
> <li>A.update(B)</li>
> <li>A.Set.intersection_update(B)</li>
> <li>A.Set.difference_update(B)</li>
> <li>A.symmetric_difference_update(B)</li>
> </ul>

> 11. The Captain's Room: Searching for the captain room number which is a unique number in the list and we can use Set.difference() to find it.

> 12. Check Subset function: to check either the set a is a subset of the set b or not.

> 13. Check Superset function: to check either the set a is Superset of the set b or not.


## 3- What’s new for you?

> #### The new thing I have to mention that this Task gives me the opportunity to revise the set functions in details.
