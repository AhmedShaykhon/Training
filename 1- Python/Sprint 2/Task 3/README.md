## 1- What ’re the methods that you used ?

> There are many important methods used. For instance, Swap Case, String Split and Join, join User Name in the string, Mutations which is how to deal with immutable data type and change the elements in it, Find a repeated string in string, String Validators functions, Text Alignment using Text function to check the text content, Text Wrap, Designer Door Mat task which implement a certain pattern, String Formatting by writing the checked number into 4 ways of machine language forms, Alphabet Rangoli is Different sizes of patterns, Capitalize! to capitalize every character of the beginning of every phrasal noun, The Minion Game! is a game of two players one of the starting with consonants and another one starting with vowels, Merge the Tools is wrapping the text depending on the number of lines which inserted by the user.  

## 2- Explain each method ..

> ### The Following fifteen note for the fifteen tasks which mentioned in our second task.
> 1. Swap Case Function: This Function objective is how to change the form of the characters which in the string from upper case to lower case and vice versa.

> 2. String Split and Join: How to change the behavior of the string in the immutable data type which is a string using split and join function.

> 3. Join User Name in a string: How to use your merge the input string with your own text.

> 4. Mutations: This Function Target is how to deal with immutable data type and change the elements in it by casting this string in to string then change in it and use join function to return it into a string.

> 5. Find a repeated string in the string: This function checks every repeated character and count it, then return the repeated string.

> 6. String Validators function: This function included a number of text validation functions which investigates the string such as:
> <ul>
> <ul>
> <li>str.isalnum(): This method checks if all the characters of a string are alphanumeric (a-z, A-Z and 0-9).</li>
> <li>str.isalpha(): This method checks if all the characters of a string are alphabetical (a-z and A-Z).</li>
> <li>str.isdigit(): This method checks if all the characters of a string are digits (0-9).</li>
> <li>str.islower(): This method checks if all the characters of a string are lowercase characters (a-z).</li>
> <li>str.isupper(): This method checks if all the characters of a string are uppercase characters (A-Z).</li>
> </ul>
> </ul>

> 7. Text Alignment using Text function to a lign the text by content in center or in right or in left such as:
> <ul>
> <ul>
> <li>.center(width): This method returns a centered string of length width.</li>
> <li>.rjust(width): This method returns a right aligned string of length width..</li>
> <li>.ljust(width): This method returns a left aligned string of length width.</li>
> </ul>
> </ul>
> <br>

> 8. Text Wrap function: this function is given a string S and width W. and wrap the string into a paragraph of width W.

> 9. Designer Door Mat: This task needs your ability of coding to create an algorithm to create its patters.

> 10. String Formatting: This function returns the checked number into 4 ways of machine language forms.

> 11. Alphabet Rangoli is Different sizes of patterns using .center function and loop.

> 12. Capitalize! : This Function is capitalized on the first character of every noun phrase.

> 13. The Minion Game!: is a game of two players one of the starting with consonants and another one starting with vowels. Moreover, A player gets a +1 point for each occurrence of the substring in the string.   

> 15. Merge the Tools: This function is wrapping the text depending on the number of lines inserted by the user. 

## 3- What’s new for you ?

> #### First of all, I observed the variety of tasks which is useful for Building patterns and dealing with strings. Besides the Text Alignment functions were new targets for me.
